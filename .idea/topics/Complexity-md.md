Navigate complexity 

Complexity os outcome of human behaviour, system interaction, uncertainly and ambiguity.

Complexity can arise at any point during the project.

Constenly evaluate and navigate project complexity to qpproach and plans enable the project teams to succesfully
navigate the entire project.

Complexity can be introduces by events or conditions 

Project tesms cancan stay vigilant in indentifiying elemnts of complexiy and use the variety of method reduce the amount
of complexity.

Project teams often cannot forcast complexity emerging because it is the result of many conditions and events 

Some of the more source of complexity are:
- human behavior 
- System behaviour 
- Uncertainly and ambiguity 
- Technological innovation 

Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approach and plans navigate potential 
to effective project delivery
